Introduction</h1>
<p>Within the last decade, there has been a growing movement of hobbyists fascinated with miniature robotic competitions with names such as Battle Bots or SumoBots. To explore this field, we partnered with a few other groups to set up a modified sumo bot competition, adapted for the desired learning objectives of this class. Our SumoBot competition will utilize fully autonomous robots designed to replicate the sport of sumo wrestling. The objective is simple; two robots will attempt to push the other out of a pre-established circular arena to establish victory.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="sec_purpose"></a>
Purpose</h1>
<p>The purpose of this source code is to run the two motors and infrared line sensors necessary to operate our designed SumoBot.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="sec_execution"></a>
Execution</h1>
<p>To properly execute this source code, a programmer capable of communicating with an ATxmega128A3U and PDI capability was used. This programmer would allow us to get code onto our microcontroller on our designed printed circuit board. The infrared line sensors were connected to the X13 and X11 headers allocated on our printed circuit boards. Lastly, there was two separate power source screw terminal blocks for the microcontroller and motors. Screw terminal block, X1, had a 6V power supply connected to power the microcontroller and all sensors being used. Screw terminal block, X2, had a 12V power supply connected to power the two motors being used.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="sec_testing"></a>
Testing</h1>
<p>To effectively validate or debug our board, we approached board assembly in a methodical way that would allow us to isolate any potential bugs in our system. We began by soldering all power supply subsystems on the board and checked the voltage regulator outputs to ensure proper voltage levels. We then proceeded to verification of the level shifters. Ensure that our USB to serial UART interface was working properly. Lastly, we ensured the functionality of the microcontroller being used. <br />
 </p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="sec_non-implementations"></a>
Non-Implementations</h1>
<p>With our ultrasonic sensors, we were also unable to incorporate them with the FreeRTOS system. We did not spend extensive time debugging this, but we suspect that there could be a timing conflict. The ultrasonic sensors were coded to utilize interrupts for measuring time to objects. This may have been conflicting with other high level interrupts being utilized within FreeRTOS. Additionally, as many other groups were using the same HC SR04 ultrasonic sensors, we were concerned that our sensor could interpret their ranging signal as an input and give us inaccurate readings. With this in mind, we decided our efforts would be more worthwhile to focus on developing code for our other sensors. The QRE1113 infrared line sensors were also not implemented with the FreeRTOS system. The digital sensor works by setting the input/output pin as a output to high to charge the capacitor on the board. Then, the input/output line to an input and measure the amount of time it takes the capacitor to discharge. We were not able to measure the amount of time the capacitor takes to discharge depending what type of color the sensor was above (white or black).</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="sec_limitations"></a>
Limitations</h1>
<p>The infrared line sensors ultimately used (OSOYOO Infrared Sensor) could pose potential problems if it picks up light reflections from other components. The line sensors could trigger a false reading if there is too much light pollution. The pin generating the PWM signal for Motor 2 was causing trouble when testing our SumoBot. We were getting an inconsistent signal, which ultimately lead to our second motor not running.</p>
<p>The code is located at our group's bit buck repository:</p>
